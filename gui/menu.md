## Proposal types

There are currently two categories of proposals: basic and advanced, as described below.

**Basic:**

- Signal request  
- DAO token request (request loot or shares from the DAO)  
- DAO Token swap (request loot and shares in exchange for tokens)  
- ERC-20 token transfer (request ERC-20 tokens from the treasury)  
- Network token transfer (request network native token from the treasury)

**Advanced:**

- Use WalletConnect (interact with external contracts and applications)
- Update Governance settings (propose changes to voting, grace period, quorum, minimum retention, sponsor threshold or offering)  
- Update Token Settings (propose to make loot and shares transferrable)  
- Add Shaman (Grant DAO permissions to an external contract)
- Remove member (Change a memberâ€™s voting tokens into non-voting tokens)
- Multicall proposal builder (Use the transaction builder to propose a multicall proposal)
