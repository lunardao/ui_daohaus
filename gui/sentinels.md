# Sentinels

LunarDAO Sentinels is a committee responsible for executing community decisions in regards to treasury (multi-sig) and consists of eight members in total. Sentinels can reject a malicious proposal even if it has been approved by the community. Five are needed to execute a decision.

The suggested time frame to be a multi-sig participant is two years. The transfer will happen when there is someone who can take over when the time is due and is not a rigid measurement. To rotate responsibilities to new Sentinels supports a level of diversity of thought in this important governance responsibility. 

*A malicious proposal can include:*

- Proposals which are harmful to LunarDAO mission and goals.  
- Proposals which are supporting centralization and hegemony.  
- Proposals which are supporting surveillance projects or measures.  
- Proposals which are supporting regulatory measures.  
- Proposal which are suspected of/or exposed as having malintent ie. a quickly pushed proposals which aims to drain the treasury.

If Sentinels reject a proposal, they are expected to share a report which include the motivation for this decision before the following community meeting after the event. The decision and content of the mentioned report will be discussed and evaluated in this meeting.

As a part of the [roadmap](https://lunardao.net/roadmap.html) the squad will vote if to continue to have a multi-sig based treasury or move to a complete trustless setup.

**Sentinel members**

Builders and teams in our ecosystem of privacy oriented projects are often public, using known pseudonyms, and are recognized in crypto communities. In [*'Why anon'*](https://lunardao.net/why-anon.html) we explained why anonymity and privacy are not only important for lunarpunk movement, but also the only choice for the [Stewards](https://wiki.lunardao.net/governance.html#stewards) (core team/ founders) of LunarDAO.

To build trust, and decentralize, the DAO is collborating with six Sentinels who are not core-members. The Sentinels are:

These are guidelines to support Sentinels in their responsibility. It is the responsibility of the whole community to support the governance process, in which the forum discussion is an essential part. This ensures democratic governance and gives opportunities for feedback on proposals before initiating voting. Through the LIP process, if LunarDAO Community and Squad members have expressed criticisms and evaluated a proposal to be non-aligned with community sentiment or otherwise unsupported, the author should consider re-writing the LIP or decide to not proceed with voting.
