# What is LunarDAO

LunarDAO is an investment fund based on lunarpunk philosophy. By allocating funds in privacy projects & anonymity tooling we aim to expand freedom and ensure sovereignty. Squad wealth leverages collective strength and captures value in the ecosystem and brings return to the members by building a treasury (portfolio) of privacy assets. 

Any member can exit at any time. Members are anonymous hence can participate in building this vision without fear of frozen funds, legal implications or any kind of repression. See [Anonymizing assets](https://wiki.lunardao.net/anonymizing_assets.html) for more information on how to stay anonymous while participating in the DAO. We aim to move to a full anon setup and develop infrastructure for a parallel economy outside of control and centralization.
